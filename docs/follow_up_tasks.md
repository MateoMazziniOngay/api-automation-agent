# Follow-up Testing Tasks

The initial test suite only covers a small portion of the repository. The follow tasks should be created in the project board for complete coverage:

- [ ] Add tests for `LLMService` using mocked language model calls.
- [ ] Add tests for `CommandService.run_command` and `run_command_with_fix`.
- [ ] Add tests for API processors (swagger and postman).
- [ ] Increase coverage for configuration utilities and the dependency injection container.
